## Packages
qrcode.react | Generating QR codes on the ID card
react-barcode | Generating Barcodes on the ID card
html2canvas | Exporting the DOM elements (cards) as images

## Notes
The application generates Student ID Cards (KTM) visually.
It uses inline styles for the card components to ensure precise pixel dimensions for export/printing.
State management is handled locally for the form, but saved cards use the backend API.
